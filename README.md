# QGIA Knowledge Spine

**Quantum Geopolitical Intelligence Agency - Comprehensive Knowledge Library**

## Mission Overview

This repository contains the systematic knowledge architecture supporting QGIA's quantum-inspired geopolitical forecasting capabilities. With 551 personnel, $2.847B annual budget, and 500TB daily intelligence processing, QGIA maintains 84.7% accuracy for 12-month forecasts with 127-day early warning lead times.

## Integration with QGIA v4.0.0

All documents are structured for seamless integration with:
- **OSIQP v4.2.1** quantum sentiment analysis (156 qubit-equivalent, <50ms latency)
- **QSFE** (Quantum Superposition Forecasting Engine)
- **EDM** (Entanglement Dynamics Mapper)
- **ABCP** (Adaptive Bayesian Conflict Predictor)
- **RPRN** (Recursive Pattern Recognition Network)
- **TCA** (Temporal Convergence Analyzer)

## Document Standards

Each knowledge spine document includes:
1. **Executive Overview** - Core concepts and operational relevance
2. **Theoretical Framework** - Academic foundations and key debates
3. **Mathematical Formulations** - Quantitative models and equations
4. **Historical Case Studies** - Empirical validation and pattern recognition
5. **QGIA Integration Protocols** - Specific hooks to quantum frameworks
6. **Confidence Calibration** - Uncertainty quantification and validation metrics
7. **Intelligence Collection Requirements** - SIGINT/HUMINT/GEOINT/OSINT priorities
8. **References** - Peer-reviewed literature and classified sources

## Usage Guidelines

### For QGIA Analysts [TS/SCI Clearance]
1. Review relevant documents before threat assessments
2. Cross-reference theoretical frameworks with current intelligence
3. Update confidence scores based on evolving evidence
4. Integrate quantum coherence metrics from OSIQP
5. Calibrate probabilistic forecasts against historical accuracy

### For Collection Assets
- Intelligence Requirements (IRs) sections specify collection priorities
- Taskings aligned with CENTCOM/EUCOM/INDOPACOM/SOCOM/CYBERCOM
- Real-time feedback loops for 500TB daily processing

### For Policy Consumers
- Executive summaries provide actionable intelligence without technical detail
- Confidence intervals (0.00-1.00) quantify uncertainty
- Time-phased recommendations: 0-30d urgent, 1-6mo strategic, 6-12mo policy

## Classification

**UNCLASSIFIED // FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY**

Contains methodological frameworks and theoretical foundations. Specific threat assessments, collection methods, and intelligence sources remain classified TS/SCI and are maintained in QGIA's secure systems.
